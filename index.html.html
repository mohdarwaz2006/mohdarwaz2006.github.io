    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> I’m Mohd Arwaz, a third-year Mechanical Engineering student at VIT Vellore. I’m passionate about robotics, mechanical design, and using technology to solve real-world problems. I’ve improved my design skills through tools like SolidWorks and Fusion 360, where I create 3D models and detailed engineering drawings. I also use simulation tools to test and improve how my designs work in different conditions.

Apart from academics, I enjoy working on robotics projects. I use platforms like Arduino and ROS to build systems that work together, and I’ve learned tools like MATLAB to support my work. I also know how to code and have experience with HTML, Java, and Python to create websites, simple apps, and automate tasks.

I'm also an entrepreneur and run my own e-commerce store called NXT Indian Mart, where I sell a range of products online. This has helped me learn about digital marketing, managing ads, and growing a business through platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Shopify.

When I’m not working on engineering or business projects, I like to play basketball and sketch new product ideas or designs. This website shows my work, skills, and interests. Thank you for visiting, and I’m excited about what lies ahead!

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>CAD & Design:</strong> I use SolidWorks and Fusion 360 to make 3D models of parts and products. I can design things like machine parts or tools with accurate dimensions. I also create drawings that show how things are made or assembled. These designs can be used for making real physical products.</li>
      <li><strong>Robotics:</strong> I work with Arduino and ROS to build and control robots. I can connect sensors and motors to make robots move or respond to the environment. I also write code to control how the robot behaves. I enjoy solving problems to make robots work better.</li>
      <li><strong>Simulations:</strong> I use tools like SolidWorks Simulation and Fusion 360 Analysis to test how strong or efficient a design is before it's built. I can check things like how much weight a part can handle or how it moves. This helps me find and fix problems early. It saves time and materials.</li>
      <li><strong>Programming:</strong> I can write code using HTML, Java, and Python. I use these languages to build websites, small programs, or control machines. I understand how to write clean and simple code. I also know how to test and fix any errors in my code.</li>
      <li><strong>Marketing & Business:</strong> I understand the basics of digital marketing and how to run ads online. I can help promote a product using Google Ads or social media platforms. I also know how to track how well an ad is doing. This helps improve business results.</li>
      <li><strong>E-commerce</strong>Owner of an e-commerce store, NXT Indian Mart, where I sell a variety of products. You can find me on Instagram, Facebook, and Shopify. I manage everything from product listings and customer service to order processing and marketing, gaining hands-on experience in running a full online business.</li>
